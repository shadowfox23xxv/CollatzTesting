The purpose of this repo is to devolope a Java program able to test the collatz conjecture to the furthest extreme possible within the bounds of available hardware and software.  As this is being handled by a relativly new programmer with limited hardware, it is not expected to make any great strides towards dissproving the conjecture.  It is simply an excercise to test what can be acheived.
